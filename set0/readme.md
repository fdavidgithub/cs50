# Problem set 0

**Using Scratch your project need:**

[ ] Must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.
[ ] Must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
[ ] Must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.
[ ] Must use at least one sound.
[ ] Should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than Ivyâ€™s Hardest Game. As such, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.
